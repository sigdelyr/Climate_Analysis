# Climate Analysis & Exploration

# Tools / Technologies used:

Python, Flask App & SQLAlchemy

# Summary 

In this project, I will analyze the climate for Hawaii's for a long holiday vaccation. To begin, Python and SQLAlchemy were used to do basic climate analysis and data exploration. Precipitation was analyzed for the past 12 months. The results were then plotted using Matplotlib. Next the stations were analyzed. The total number of stations were calculated, then the most active station was determined. Finally, the last 12 months of temperature data was queried, filtered and plotted into different charts. 


# Climate App
Flask app was designed to analyze the Hawaii climate data. It included the following routes:

/

/api/v1.0/precipitation

/api/v1.0/stations

/api/v1.0/tobs

/api/v1.0/< start >

/api/v1.0/< start >/< end >
